# 🧠 Financial Chatbot Prototype – BCG GenAI Job Simulation

This is a Python-based chatbot developed as part of the **BCG GenAI Job Simulation** on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/). It answers five predefined financial questions using real company data extracted from 10-K and 10-Q reports.

---

## 💡 How It Works

- The chatbot runs in the command line or Jupyter Notebook and listens for **exact** user queries.
- It matches user input against **five predefined financial questions**.
- If a match is found, it returns a **static, prewritten answer**.
- If no match is found, it returns a **polite fallback message**.

---

## 📋 Predefined Queries

The chatbot understands only these specific questions:

1. What is the total revenue for Microsoft in 2024?  
2. How has Tesla’s net income changed from 2023 to 2024?  
3. What is Apple’s total assets in 2010?  
4. What is Microsoft’s cash flow from operating activities in 2023?  
5. What is Tesla’s total liabilities in 2022?

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Only **exact matches** are supported (no NLP or fuzzy matching).
- **Command-line** or **Jupyter Notebook interface only** — no web or GUI.
- Uses **static responses** instead of dynamically computed data.
